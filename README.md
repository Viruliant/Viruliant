Viruliant
---------
Viruliant aims to be an SharedLibrary/Executable made to translate from a
[Subset of R5RS](/Cite/R5RS/R5RS-Language) to [C99](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf)"
in a similar fashion, to how OOP has been added to C99 in
[Object-oriented design patterns in the kernel, part 1](http://lwn.net/Articles/444910/)
and [part 2](http://lwn.net/Articles/446317/).

Viruliant is also to provide the abilities seen in [Ben Swift Debugging AND
Recompiling the currently running application](http://vimeo.com/99891379).
[AntiThread](https://github.com/rustyrussell/ccan/tree/master/ccan/antithread) &
[mkconfExample](Cite/mkconfExample) will serve as quotes & libs of part of how
generated code will appear.

All of Viruliant is to be in the spirit of [falling out for free(after you've
waded through muck)](http://youtu.be/h6Z7vx9iUB8?t=1h17m33s).

More Information
----------------
[Sorenson's Acoustic DUAL Piano Scheme Setup Video(NOT in Stereo)](http://youtu.be/yY1FSsUV-8c?t=140s)
shall serve as a more layman's description of what a live Scheme interpreter or
compiler can look like; It is also an Excellent Musical Piece, w/Narration of
how his code generates it.

This page is just a readme, for more information about actually using Viruliant
please consult [The Wiki](): 

mkconfExample
-------------
[dlopen_self.c](Cite/mkconfExample/dlopen_self.c)-
Shows how to use dlsym to examine the running executable's properties. This lets
you, e.g., look up one of your own global variables by its string *name*, which
is pretty amazing.

[dlopen_gcc.c](Cite/mkconfExample/dlopen_gcc.c)-
Shows how to write some code at runtime, compile the code into a shared library,
link in the new shared library, and use its new functions.

[dlopen_libc.c](Cite/mkconfExample/dlopen_libc.c)-
Shows how to use dlopen to examine a shared libraries' symbols and functions. In
this case, we look up and call the math library's "cos" routine. (Just like
Linux' man dlopen).
